Solution to getting info from the rest of the partitions(It would make more sense to group all of this with the
previous, but I did not so the code is simpler to follow:) The below also is horrible coding practice,
you should definately use a loop or a function. The reason for this is to build muscle memory.

And hopefully it is so painful that it makes you want to do proper coding :)
