Example 1

This is some text to test how regular expressions work. But 74i5 isn't.
john.doe@example.com is one email address.
Here's another: jane.doe@example.net
Type in the characters is into the “Regular Expression” area.
sarah.connor@fake.org
More random text.

Yet another email: emily.blunt@random.com
Even more random text here.

Will match 01213315000 but not 01212.
However, . results in matching 0ABCDEFHIJ because . means any character. To match numbers or specific characters need some way to limit the characters at a position.

Example 2

How can we search for slight variations of the same word, for example specialized and specialised?
Effectively the same word varying by s or z, e.g.
specialize
specialise
We could do two separate searches, one for specialise and one for specialize.
If we use. to give the expression speciali.e we can find the above words but will also match specialiie, a mis-spelling.
We can look for variations by making use of a character class.
