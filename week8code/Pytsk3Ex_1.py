'''
The following skeleton code is designed to help you with the structure of the practice program
for the pytsk Workshop 1
As always, if you feel like something does not make sense, ask for help from your tutor, or
read the relevant documentation.
'''

# 1 Import the required Library


# 2 Create a new IMG_Info object by opening the file and name object as diskimage


# 3 Display the size of the disk image in raw bytes


# 4 closes the disk image much like the close method unlinked a file from a program using Python File I/O.


# 5 Display the number of sectors there are in the disk image file


# 6 Create a Volume_Info object for the Img_Info object to get a Volume_Info object containing the partitions defined in the disk image


# 7 Displays the number of partitions pytsk3 has identified in the disk image.


# 8 Defines the start of a for loop for processing each partition in the disk image.


    # 9 displays a description of the partition’s type, start sector and number of sectors in the partition

    # Convert the bytes into a string for volume.desc


    # 11 This statement adds the current volume’s start sector to the end of the list each iteration


# 12 Display the contents of the partitions list
